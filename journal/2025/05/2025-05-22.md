# Thursday, May 22nd 2025 (Week 21)

## Top 3 priorities

- [x] Fix pagination bug in user dashboard (#234)
- [ ] Complete unit tests for new UserProfile component
- [x] Address PR feedback on authentication integration

## Project: User Dashboard Revamp

| Component          | Status      | Est. Completion |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| User Profile       | In Progress | May 23          |
| Activity Feed      | Completed   | May 20          |
| Settings Panel     | Not Started | May 26          |
| Data Visualization | Blocked     | Pending API     |

## Progress made

Successfully fixed the pagination bug in the dashboard! The issue was related to state management:

```javascript
// Before: State wasn't being reset properly
const handlePageChange = (page) => {
  setCurrentPage(page);
  // Missing reset of other parameters
};

// After: Added proper state reset
const handlePageChange = (page) => {
  setCurrentPage(page);
  setSelectedItems([]);
  resetFilters();
};
```

Other accomplishments:

- Implemented API mocking in Jest tests for the UserProfile component:
  - Created mock responses for user data endpoints
  - Learned how to simulate loading states and error conditions
- Pair programmed with Sarah to integrate the new auth flow with the dashboard
- Updated API documentation for the 3 endpoints I've been working with

## Blockers

1. **Testing edge cases**: Can't figure out how to properly test the error boundary for the UserProfile component when API fails
2. **Environment issues**:

   ```text
   Error: Cannot find module 'docker-compose'
   at Function.Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1075:15)
   ```

3. Waiting for the `/api/v2/user/activity-stats` endpoint from the backend team

## Tomorrow

- [ ] Finish the remaining UserProfile component tests
  - [ ] Error states
  - [ ] Permission handling
- [ ] Implement Sarah's feedback on error handling:

  > Consider using a custom hook for error management
  > instead of repeating try/catch blocks

- [ ] Schedule 30-min meeting with Tom about testing best practices
