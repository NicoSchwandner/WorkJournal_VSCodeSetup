## ‚ö° Quickstart

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicoSchwandner/work-journal-vs-code-setup.git
cd work-journal-vs-code-setup
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Private Repository (Optional but Recommended)

To keep your journal entries private, initialize a new private GitHub repository and push your cloned copy there:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Open in VSCode

```bash
code .
```

### Step 4: Generate Today's Journal Entry

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then run this command in your VSCode terminal:

```bash
npx work-journal new --open
```

This command:

- Generates a Markdown file at `journal/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Automatically selects the right template (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Opens the file directly in VSCode.
